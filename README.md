# ðŸ‘¤ UserDemoApp

A modular, scalable iOS application built with Swift and UIKit. The app fetches and displays a list of users from a demo REST API. It follows **Clean Architecture**, utilizes **MVVM** for the presentation layer, and adheres to **SOLID principles** with a strong emphasis on readability, testability, and maintainability.

## ðŸš€ Features

- ðŸ”¹ Fetch user list from a remote REST API
- ðŸ”¹ Display users in a table view
- ðŸ”¹ Implements MVVM architecture
- ðŸ”¹ Clean separation of concerns across modules
- ðŸ”¹ Asynchronous data fetching with `async/await`
- ðŸ”¹ Unit test coverage above 80%
- ðŸ”¹ Built with native Swift libraries including Combine

---

## ðŸ“± Platform & Language

- **Platform**: iOS
- **Language**: Swift
- **Minimum Deployment Target**: iOS 18.0
- **Xcode Version**: 16
- **Swift Version**: 5

---

## ðŸ“¦ Modules

The app is structured into well-defined modules:

- `BaseUI` â€“ Common UI components and styling
- `Network` â€“ Handles API communication using `URLSession` and `async/await`
- `BusinessLogic` â€“ Core logic and use cases
- `AppCore` â€“ Shared models, extensions, and utilities

---

## ðŸ§± Architecture

- **Pattern**: MVVM
- **Principles**: SOLID, Clean Architecture
- **Frameworks**: UIKit, Combine

### MVVM Breakdown

| Layer      | Component              |
|------------|------------------------|
| Model      | `User`                 |
| View       | `UserListViewController` |
| ViewModel  | `UserListViewModel`    |

- ViewModel exposes observable state
- Handles async API fetching and error handling
- Purely testable and decoupled from UIKit

---

## ðŸ”Œ Networking

- Built with **native `URLSession`** using `async/await`
- All networking concerns encapsulated in the `Network` module
- Custom error types for robust error handling
- Fully mockable services for easy testing

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing

- **Testing Framework**: `XCTest`
- **Test Coverage**: 80%+
- **How to Run Tests**:
  - In Xcode: Press `âŒ˜ + U` or go to **Product > Test**
  - This runs all test cases and gathers code coverage metrics

> The architecture enables easy mocking of dependencies and promotes isolated testing of ViewModels and networking logic.
